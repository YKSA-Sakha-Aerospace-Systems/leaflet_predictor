# YKSA Edition:

- Prediction altitude per datetime graph
- Tawhiri API [YKSA Edition][1] required


## Introduction

Tawhiri is the name given to the next version of the CUSF Landing Prediction
Software, which will probably be different enough from the current version
(see below) to warrant a new name.

The name comes from a
[M&#257;ori](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_people)
god of weather, which rather aptly
&ldquo;drove Tangaroa and his progeny into the sea &rdquo;
[(WP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawhiri).

## More information

Please see the [CUSF wiki](http://www.cusf.co.uk/wiki/), which contains pages
on [Tawhiri](http://www.cusf.co.uk/wiki/tawhiri:start) and [prediction in
general](http://www.cusf.co.uk/wiki/landing_predictor).

[More detailed API and setup documentation](http://tawhiri.cusf.co.uk/).

## Setup

### Predictor

â€¦is written for Python 3, is compatible with Python 2, and needs Cython:

```bash
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

The last line (re-)builds the Cython extensions, and needs to be run again
after modifying any `.pyx` files.


### Downloader

The downloader was written before Python had good cooperative concurrency
support, and so is instead a [separate
application](https://github.com/cuspaceflight/tawhiri-downloader) in OCaml.
